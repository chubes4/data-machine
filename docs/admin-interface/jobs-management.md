# Jobs Management Interface

Real-time job monitoring and administration interface providing visibility into pipeline execution status, performance metrics, and administrative controls.

## Jobs Overview

**Job Listing**: Comprehensive table view showing recent jobs with:
- Job ID for unique identification and tracking
- Pipeline and Flow name combinations for context
- Execution status with color-coded indicators
- Creation timestamp for scheduling analysis
- Completion timestamp for performance tracking

**Status Indicators**: Visual status system using WordPress list table patterns:
- **Completed**: Green indicator for successful job completion
- **Failed**: Red indicator for jobs with errors or exceptions
- **Other**: Default styling for pending, running, or intermediate states

## Job Data Structure

**Core Information**:
- **Job ID**: Sequential identifier for tracking and reference
- **Pipeline/Flow**: Combined display showing template and instance names
- **Status**: Current execution state (completed, failed, running, pending)
- **Timestamps**: Creation and completion times in readable format

**Performance Metrics**:
- Execution duration calculation from creation to completion
- Success/failure rates across pipeline types
- Processing volume and throughput analysis

## Administrative Controls

**Jobs Admin Modal**: Administrative interface accessible via "Admin" button providing:
- Bulk job management operations
- System performance metrics
- Database maintenance tools
- Export and reporting capabilities

**Cleanup Operations**: Administrative tools for:
- Clearing completed jobs beyond retention period
- Removing failed job data and associated files
- Processed items tracking maintenance
- Database optimization and cleanup

## Job Status Management

**Real-Time Updates**: Live status updates without page refresh showing:
- Job progression through pipeline steps
- Current step execution status
- Error reporting and failure details
- Completion notifications and results

**Filter and Search**: Interface controls for:
- Status-based filtering (completed, failed, running)
- Date range selection for historical analysis
- Pipeline-specific job filtering
- Flow instance filtering for targeted monitoring

## Error Handling Display

## Database Integration

**Jobs Table Access**: Direct integration with `wp_dm_jobs` table:
- Efficient querying with pagination support
- Sorting by multiple columns and criteria
- Index utilization for performance optimization
- Relationship joins with pipeline and flow data

**Data Cleanup**: Automated and manual cleanup processes:
- Configurable retention policies for completed jobs
- Failed job data preservation for debugging
- Processed items tracking maintenance
- File repository cleanup for associated job files

## User Experience Features

**Empty State Handling**: User-friendly display when no jobs exist:
