# Data Machine Documentation

Complete user documentation for Data Machine, the AI-first WordPress plugin that combines a visual pipeline builder, conversational chat agent, REST API, and handler/tool extensibility under a single workflow engine.

## Quick Navigation

### Core Concepts
- **Engine Execution**: Breakdown of four-action execution cycle, Single Item Execution Model, and job status logic.
- **Troubleshooting Problem Flows**: Automated monitoring of consecutive failures/no-items and how to resolve them.
- **Architecture**: End-to-end breakdown of execution engine, services layer, and handler infrastructure.
- **Abilities API**: WordPress 6.9 capability discovery and execution for Data Machine operations.
- **Database Schema**: Tables that persist pipelines, flows, jobs, and processed items.
- **Changelog**: Historical summary of notable releases and architectural changes.

### Engine & Services
- **Universal Engine**: Shared AI infrastructure for pipeline and chat agents.
- **AI Conversation Loop**: Turn-based conversation execution with directive orchestration.
- **AI Directives System**: Hierarchical directive injection for contextual AI behavior.
- **Tool Execution**: Centralized discovery, validation, and execution of AI tools.
- **Tool Manager**: Runtime tool enablement, provider checks, and contextual metadata.
- **Request Builder**: Directive-aware construction of provider requests.
- **Conversation Manager**: Message normalization, logging, and tool call tracking.
- **Prompt Builder**: Priority-based directive registration via filters.
- **Parameter Systems**: Unified parameter handling across tools and handlers.
- **Tool Result Finder**: Utility for interpreting tool responses inside data packets.
- **OAuth Handlers**: Base classes for OAuth1/OAuth2 providers and app-password flows.
- **Handler Registration Trait**: Centralized registration pattern for fetch, publish, and update handlers.
- **HTTP Client**: Standardized outbound request flow for handlers with structured logging and browser-mode header support.
- **Import/Export System**: Pipeline configuration backup, migration, and sharing functionality.

### Handler Documentation
- **Fetch Handlers**: Source-specific data retrieval with deduplication, filtering, and engine data storage.
- **Publish Handlers**: Modular destination integrations with consistent response formatting and logging.
- **Update Handlers**: Idempotent WordPress updates that respect engine parameters.

### AI Tools
- **Tools Overview**: Global and context-aware tools available to AI agents.
- **Execute Workflow**: Modular execution of multi-step workflows from the chat toolset.
- **Global Tools**: Google Search, Local Search, Web Fetch, WordPress Post Reader, and others used across agents.
- **Chat Tools**: AddPipelineStep, ApiQuery, ConfigureFlowSteps, ConfigurePipelineStep, CreateFlow, CreatePipeline, RunFlow, UpdateFlow, and other workflow management tools.

### API Reference
- **API Overview**: Catalog of REST endpoints for API consumers.
- **Endpoints**: Auth, Execute, Files, Flows, Jobs, Logs, and other REST resources.

### Development
- **Hooks**: Core actions, filters, and engine hooks for extension development.
- **REST Integration**: Patterns for extending the REST API and custom endpoints.

### Admin Interface
- **Pipeline Builder**: React-based page for creating pipelines, configuring steps, and enabling tools.
- **Settings Configuration**: Provider credentials, tool defaults, and global behavior settings.
- **Jobs Management**: React-based job history and admin cleanup actions.
